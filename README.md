the script run_analyis.R should be executed from the base folder.  

As described in the comments in run_analysis.R, the script 
* combines selected features (std dev and means of measurements) from the training and test data
* creates a tidy data frame (tidy_long) containing the selected features from each observation with the activity and subject in the same set
* tidy_long is then summarized into a data frame, tidy_summary, which has the mean of each variable for each subject and each activity.
